# gma2-pool-cleaner
Cleans up your object pools

This is a LUA plugin for GrandMA2 lighting software

It will comb thru an assigned pool from a given start object ID to end object ID searching for duplicate names and delete any duplicates further into the pool. It does not actually check if the data contained in the objects is duplicate, so use with caution. Always make a backup showfile before using an unknown plugin :)



### Features to be added
  - Alphabetization (and/or other sorting features)

  - Pool compression, i.e. move all objects as close to postion 1 as posible
